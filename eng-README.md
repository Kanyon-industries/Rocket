### Permanent free access for all amateur rocketeers
<br>
This software was developed by Jude ma and Huangsky. Jude ma passed away in March 2023 and would like to honor his contribution.
<br>
This software is designed for rocket research beginners to provide ansys and other professional software as a lower alternative, the software supports solid | liquid | hybrid of three types of engines integrated calculation function. At the same time has a mechanical analysis, part of the ballistic simulation, combustion velocity analysis, flange calculation and other functions.

### Permanent free access for all amateur rocketeers
<br>
This system was developed by CKD and kk.
<br>
The test stand utilizes aluminum profiles and laser-cut Q235 steel plates as a modular foundation, employing transparent polycarbonate panels as explosion-proof shields to effectively prevent experimental accidents from causing harm to personnel and equipment.
<br>
This system is developed based on the STM32 platform and includes features such as pressure acquisition, real-time display, wireless data transmission, data storage, wireless ignition system, and valve control system.
<br>
Ignition, emergency stops, and additional customizable functions can be performed using a remote control with password protection.
<br>
The pressure measurement system achieves a maximum sampling rate of 80Hz and enables real-time storage through a built-in SD card, ensuring the collection of valid data at any point during the experiment.
<br>
The system is powered by two independent power sources. Due to potential interference from servo startup operations, power and IO interface isolation measures have been implemented for the microcontroller.
<br>
The test stand allows for the adjustment of the engine clamping diameter and can accommodate rocket engines with diameters ranging from 40mm to 310mm. The default installation size supports wheel-type pressure sensors with a range of 0-2T. By modifying the baseplate installation dimensions, pressure sensors with different ranges can be easily substituted.
